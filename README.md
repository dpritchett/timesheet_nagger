[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/timesheet_nags.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/timesheet_nags)
[![travisci status badge](https://travis-ci.org/dpritchett/timesheet_nags.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/github/dpritchett/timesheet_nags)

Goal: To remind you daily when your timesheet is out of date.

Requirements: 

- [Harvest API credentials](https://id.getharvest.com/developers)
- OSX Sierra and up
- Ruby 2.2 - 2.7

## Usage

* `gem install timesheet_nags`
* Run `timesheet_nags` to get a live check - it'll annoy you if you haven't updated your timesheet in over a day (and today's not Monday).


### Scheduling

I'm using a crontab.  Run `crontab -e` and then paste this in, save, and exit. Note that I used the full path to my executable, which in my case is in an `asdf` folder somewhere.

```sh
HARVEST_TOKEN='redacted'
HARVEST_ACCOUNT_ID='redacted'

# timesheet nags at 10 and 4
0 10 * * * /Users/daniel/.asdf/shims/timesheet_nag >>/tmp/stdout.log 2>>/tmp/stderr.log
0 16 * * * /Users/daniel/.asdf/shims/timesheet_nag >>/tmp/stdout.log 2>>/tmp/stderr.log
```


## Future possibilities

- More nag configuration
- Support backends other than Harvest and OSX growl
